Blackjack
=========

1. It doesn't display the players hand yet and still just displays all the cards. also the buttons arent there yet.
2. The code is easy to read and understand. My grandma could read the code and get an idea of whats going on.
3. classes are used as objects. They make complex java programs by putting a bunch of objects together and having 
   them work as a single unit in order to complete a common goal.
4. private can only be used inside the class public can be called from anywhere in the program
5. a class is used to make big things such as objects frames and windows. an instance is used to do something that only one object
   should need. such as finding the x and y velocity of the item.
6. inheritence is used to get stuff from a parent class. it is beneficial because if youre making a bunch of objects
   under that one parent class you only have to change the code once instead of changing it for each of the individual
   objects
7. this is to call a variable that is inside the class you are coding in. super calls the method from the objects 
   parent class that has a similar name. this.init(); is calling init from the current objects parent class
8. state and behavior
9. .......
